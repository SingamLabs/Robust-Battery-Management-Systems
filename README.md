# Robust-Battery-Management-Systems
This is the repository with matlab codes for three chapters from the RBMS book by Dr. Balakumar Balasingam.
All codes are written in MATLAB 2022a.

# Chapter 02: Review of Math
Chapter 02 briefly summarizes some required mathematical concepts in estimation theory and numerical methods. 
demoKF1.m generates the resistance and resistance change estimates for Example 2.4 using the kalman filter. 
demoKF2.m compares the estimates of two filters with different process noise initializations in Example 2.5. The NIS of the filter is also plotted here to identify model-mismatch. 
demoKF3.m generates the KF estimates for Example 2.6
